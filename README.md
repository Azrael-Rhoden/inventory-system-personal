# How to play:
    to play quest to 1000 gold you first enter your characters name and then you will be prompted to enter either easy medium  or hard.
    this will determine where in the world you will go when you arrive you will discover a monster and can choose to run from it or fight it.
    if you choose to run the encounter ends and you keep moving if you choose to fight it combat will begin and if you have better stats than the monster you win.
    when you win combat the monster will drop items if you are in the easy location you will never get anything other than misc items.
    the medium location will drop weapons and armors and the hard location will drop all three.
    after completing an encounter if your health is lower than your max health you will be prompted to rest in town if you choose to do so your health will regenerate and you will be able
    to enter the shop where you can buy new gear or sell your collected gear equipped items will not be present in the list of sellable items.
    after you leave the shop you will be free to return to the world and to collect more gear if your gold amount exceeds or equals 1000 you win.
    if your health reaches 0 you lose.
    you may also quit the game by typing n when you are asked if you want to continue your journey.
